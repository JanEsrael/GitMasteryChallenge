Yes, to make a commit in the "pull-request-branch," you can create another file in your repository and then add and commit the new file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Make sure you are on the "pull-request-branch" by running the command:
   ````
   git branch
   ```
   Verify that the "pull-request-branch" is listed and has an asterisk (*) next to it, indicating that it is the currently active branch. If not, switch to the branch using the command:
   ````
   git checkout pull-request-branch
   ```

2. Create a new file in your project's directory or make changes to an existing file. You can use your preferred text editor or IDE to create the file.

3. Once you have created or modified the file, stage it to be included in the commit by running the command:
   ````
   git add <filename>
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with the actual name of the file you created or modified.

4. Commit the staged changes by running the command:
   ````
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
   Replace "Your commit message here" with a descriptive message that summarizes the changes introduced by the commit.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 as necessary to create additional files or make further changes and commits in the "pull-request-branch."
 git commit -m "Added file.txt and modified read.md"
```

    "Fixes #123"
    "Closes #123"
    "Resolves #123"
